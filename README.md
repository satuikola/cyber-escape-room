Educational cybersecurity escape room designed to help users recognize cyber threats, strengthen passwords, secure devices and avoid data breaches through hands-on challenges.
# 💠 Cyber Escape Room – Learn Cybersecurity Through Play

Welcome to the **Cyber Escape Room**, an interactive learning game designed to teach  
essential cybersecurity skills in a fun, visual and engaging way.

This project was created as part of the **SOC Specialist** training program.  
The original assignment was to create a *PowerPoint, video, podcast, or any other  
presentation* that demonstrates common cyber threats and how to avoid them.  

Instead of traditional formats, I chose a **gamified escape room**, because an  
interactive, story-driven approach reflects my style of learning and creating -  
and makes cybersecurity concepts more engaging and memorable.

Players navigate four themed rooms, solve challenges and collect *Cyber Crystals*  
to escape the digital trap.
