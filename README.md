against unauthorized access, data exposure and common endpoint vulnerabilities.  
Players learn how everyday habits - from locking screens to using secure  
authentication methods - directly impact the security of personal and  
organizational data.

Through multiple-choice challenges, the player practices:

• locking the workstation when stepping away, even briefly  
• understanding why sleep mode is insufficient as a security measure  
• recognizing the importance of regular updates for software, drivers and  
  operating systems to patch vulnerabilities  
• selecting the most secure mobile screen-lock methods (with biometrics offering  
  the strongest protection against unauthorized access)  
• using VPN connections to protect data on public Wi-Fi and prevent eavesdropping  
• identifying legitimate multi-factor authentication (MFA) factors such as  
  passwords, security tokens and biometrics  
• applying safe habits in public spaces — using privacy screens, avoiding  
  unattended devices and disabling automatic connection to open networks  

The room concludes with a **password and account security overview**, reinforcing  
key principles such as using unique passwords, storing them safely with password  
managers, avoiding predictable patterns, enabling MFA and updating credentials  
when compromise is suspected.

This room strengthens practical endpoint-security awareness and highlights how  
simple actions can drastically reduce the risk of device misuse and credential  
theft.

## 🔹 Password Control – Identity & Authentication  
<p align="center">
  <img src="3 Identity at risk.png" width="700">
</p>

The Identity at Risk room shifts the tone from general awareness to personal  
responsibility. Here, cybersecurity becomes directly connected to the player’s  
own digital identity. The room is presented as a fortified digital vault,  
accessible only to those who understand how to protect their credentials.

Unlike the previous rooms, this section introduces a narrative adversary - a  
masked figure who taunts the player, highlighting how curiosity, weak  
passwords and common habits can be exploited. Through this story-driven  
approach, the player sees firsthand how attackers think and why identity  
security requires constant vigilance.

The challenge segment focuses on strengthening core identity-protection skills,  
including:

• creating strong passphrases (16+ characters)  
• using complex, unpredictable password structures  
• assigning unique passwords to each account  
• recognizing poor password practices such as reuse or predictable patterns  
• identifying the most secure authentication factors (password + MFA + biometrics)  
• selecting secure mobile lock methods to prevent unauthorized access  
• evaluating app security and verifying trusted sources  
• responding safely to data breaches by changing passwords, enabling MFA  
  and monitoring account activity  

The room concludes with a mobile-security summary covering reliable security  
software, installing updates, permissions management, VPN use on public  
networks and safe app installation practices.

By blending narrative tension with hands-on decision making, this room teaches  
players how everyday identity-related choices influence their exposure to  
credential theft, impersonation and unauthorized access.

</p>

The Data Breach Protocol room introduces players to organizational-level  
security risks, focusing on how cyber incidents occur, how they can be  
prevented, and how individuals contribute to a company’s overall security  
posture. The room uses an adversarial challenge format, symbolizing the  
constant struggle between defenders and attackers.

Through scenario-based questions and visual analysis tasks, the player learns  
to identify the root causes of data breaches, spot real-world vulnerabilities  
and make informed decisions under pressure.

Core skills practiced in this room include:

• recognizing common breach vectors such as weak or reused passwords, phishing  
  emails, outdated software and human error  
• analyzing workplace environments to spot risks like unlocked screens, visible  
  passwords and weak credential hygiene  
• applying preventive measures including regular updates, employee awareness  
  training, secure access controls and multi-factor authentication  
• identifying phishing attacks and knowing when to verify, report or delete  
  suspicious messages  
• understanding which types of data require encryption and strict protection  
  (personal data, login credentials, financial records)  
• evaluating the organizational impact of breaches, including reputational  
  damage, operational downtime, financial penalties and loss of intellectual  
  property  

The room concludes with a structured summary on phishing prevention and breach  
response, reinforcing best practices for verifying senders, using MFA, keeping  
backups and monitoring accounts for suspicious activity.

This section strengthens the player’s ability to recognize organizational  
threats and understand how individual actions contribute to or prevent major  
cyber incidents.
